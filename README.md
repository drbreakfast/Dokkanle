# Dokkanle

Dokkanle is a Wordle-style daily guessing game inspired by Dokkan Battle cards. Each day, players are challenged to guess a specific Dokkan Battle card based on parts of its passive skill. As guesses are made, more information about the card is revealed, making it easier to narrow down the possibilities.

## How to Play

- **Daily Mode**: Guess the universal card of the day. A new card is featured each day, providing a fresh challenge for all players.
- **Unlimited Mode**: Guess random cards without a daily limit.

## Card Information

All Dokkan Battle card information used in the game is sourced from the [DokkanWebScraper](https://github.com/MNprojects/DokkanWebScraper/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#dokkanwebscraper) by MNprojects.
