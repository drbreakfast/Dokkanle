# Dokkanle

Dokkanle is a Wordle-style daily guessing game inspired by Dokkan Battle cards. Each day, players are challenged to guess a specific Dokkan Battle card based on parts of its passive skill, rarity, type, class, and leader skill. More information about the card can be revealed, making it easier to narrow down the possibilities.

## How to Play

- **Daily Mode**: Guess the universal card of the day. A new card is featured each day, providing a fresh challenge for all players.
- **Unlimited Mode**: Guess random cards without a daily limit.
